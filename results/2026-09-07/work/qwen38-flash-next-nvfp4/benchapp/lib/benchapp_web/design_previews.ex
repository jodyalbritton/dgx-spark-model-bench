defmodule BenchappWeb.DesignPreviews do
  @moduledoc """
  Preview functions for **this app's** components, referenced by
  `BenchappWeb.DesignManifest`.

  The kit's own components are previewed by `JobyKit.Previews`, so
  `/design` shows the same examples in every JobyKit app. You only write
  previews for what you add.

  Each public function takes `assigns` (typically `%{}`) and returns a
  small HEEx rendering the component with sensible defaults. The
  manifest registers these via `preview: &BenchappWeb.DesignPreviews.X_preview/1`,
  and `JobyKit.SignatureComponent` invokes them inside the per-component
  card's collapsible Preview section.

  Naming convention: every preview function ends in `_preview` so they
  don't collide with the imported component functions of the same name
  (e.g. `button` vs `button_preview`).

  The previews call `JobyKit.CoreComponents` directly via the
  `CoreComponents` alias so the rendered HTML matches what the manifest
  declares — no dependency on the host's `<App>Web.CoreComponents`
  resolution.
